                Making a submission can be a daunting task for many, so
                Overton's "Submission Builder" makes it easy for all interested
                parties to make their voice heard. By asking users a series of
                simple leading questions, our platform can use that information
                to assemble a perfectly structured and relevant submission
                adequate for any committee.
              </p>
              <p>
                Don't be ignored! Submissions are often rejected on trivial
                technicalities such as formatting errors. Similarly, a committee
                may reject bulk submissions that are too similar, even with
                slight variations. Instead, ensure your supporters' voices are
                heard by asking users to answer a series of questions in their
                own words and allowing our platform to assemble and send a
                properly-formatted submission on their behalf.<br/>
